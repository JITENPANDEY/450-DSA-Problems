//Intro
Good afternoon Sir/ma'am,
My name is jiten Pandey. I am from Dhanbad Jharkhand. I am currently working as a software engineer
at hashedin by deloitte. I have completed my B.Tech in IT from netaji subhash engineering college 
kolkata in this year. My overall CGPA is 8.98. 

Before hashedin I also worked as an Intern at Deltax.
At Hashedin I am currently working on APIs involving Java Vertx, for a Major American Bank with my backend team.

Apart from my professional work I have keen interest in problem solving,  I love to spend time to find solutions of problems on leetcode.

Coming to my projects I have developed several projects such as A blue collar job application which is mainly implemented forblue collar job seekers such as sweeper, peon security guard etc, next is a URL shortner which is mainly useful for shortening the long urls, Here I have used murmur3_32 bit hashing function for encyption,apart from that I have also developed a File sharing application and an exam portal.

That is from my side. Thank you.
